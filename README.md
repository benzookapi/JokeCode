# Pull requests are welcome
Pull requests to add your creative and funny code snipets are welcome but I expect them to be a single source code file (I am not stick to JavaScript!) per one theme, and be runnable alone without any extra files. Note that your merged codes are supposed to be shared in the social media above (if you share your social media ID in the pull request, **I mention you respectfully as the original source**).
